## Issue-First Branch Workflow

### WHAT

- Never make changes directly on `main`.
- Before starting work, create a GitHub Issue that describes the work.
- Perform the work on a non-`main` branch associated with that Issue.

## Documentation

### HOW

- Update related documentation when code changes affect users
- Document usage for new features in README
- Update relevant docs when interfaces change
- Split large docs into separate files in `docs/` folder
- Add links to split docs in README

## File Operations

### HOW

```bash
# File operations
git mv <old-path> <new-path>  # Move files
git rm <path>                  # Delete files
```

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The default five-role vocabulary is used. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This repository uses a single-context layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Code Organization Rules

### WHY

Maintain consistent structure to ensure readability, maintainability, and testability.
Follow single responsibility principle to minimize scope of changes.

### WHAT

- One class per file
- One test file per class
- Keep `__init__.py` files empty
- Never modify pyproject.toml when fixing linting errors

### HOW

- Create a new file when adding a new class
- Name test files as `test_<filename>.py`
- Fix lint errors in code, never relax configuration
- Place imports at the top of the file, never in the middle

## Testing Guidelines

### WHAT

- **Framework**: Use function-based tests (pytest), not class-based
- **Language**: Write test comments (especially AAA steps) and docstrings in Japanese to clarify intent
- **Strategy**: Test "What" (observable behavior/results), not "How" (implementation details)
- **Mocking**: Minimize mocks. Use real instances for domain logic; mock only external boundaries (DB, API, SMTP)
- **Architecture**: Separate domain logic from IO. Use Humble Object/Hexagonal patterns for testability
- **Scope**: Never test private methods directly. Cover them indirectly via public interfaces

### HOW

- Structure with **AAA Pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert) with explicit sections in both docstrings and code comments, written in Japanese
  - **Docstring**: Include `Arrange:`, `Act:`, `Assert:` lines describing each step
  - **Code comments**: Insert `# Arrange`, `# Act`, `# Assert` as section dividers in the test function body
- **Naming**: Use English for test function names, describing business requirements
- **File placement**: Mirror source module structure in `tests/` directory
- **Docstring**: Describe a summary of what is being tested (in Japanese)
- **Docstring style**: Use passive voice ("〜こと" form) consistently
  - Title: "〜を検証" → "〜されること", "〜が〜されること"
  - When: "〜を選択", "〜を実行" → "〜が選択され", "〜が実行される"
  - Then: "〜を返す", "〜が生成" → "〜が返されること", "〜が生成されること"

## Quality Check

### HOW

```bash
uv run task test
```
